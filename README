Hydrasect
=========

Identify and prioritize commits evaluated and built by Hydra when
bisecting Nixpkgs.  This can make the Nixpkgs bisection process much
faster, by avoiding unnecessary rebuilds caused by testing commits in
between Hydra evaluations, when commits built by Hydra (with build
results in cache.nixos.org) remain to be tested.


Installation
------------

Build dependencies:
 - Meson
 - Ninja
 - rustc

Runtime dependencies:
 - Git
 - curl

In most cases, installation should be as simple as

	meson build
	ninja -C build install


Usage
-----

The hydrasect-search program, when run in a Nixpkgs bisect, prints the
closest commit(s) to HEAD that have been evaluated by hydra.nixos.org,
and are yet to be tested in the bisect.

So, to run a Hydra-aware Nixpkgs bisect, any time git bisect checks
out a commit to be tested, simply run:

    git checkout $(hydrasect-search | head -1)

If there is a suitable Hydra commit, it will be checked out and can be
tested instead of Git's suggestion.
